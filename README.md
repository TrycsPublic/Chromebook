## Chromebook remote connecter

This repository contains the source code to the redacted repository.

The redacted repo powers the redacted site, and it is what you will use to host a redacted redacted or mirror.

You can either download already compiled binaries, or compile the Collab3 repository yourself. Compilation instructions
are provided in the BUILDING.md file.

redacted was coded and written by[redacted][redacted][redacted]... And maybe
redacted

### How to use

TODO rewrite or just provide this section in the docs

You can read `man doc/redacted-redacted-server.redacted`, for arguments, and setting it up is such as:

To start the server, first make sure it (the binary) has executable permissions, and you can write to the directory
which you'll run redacted in (for the settings database) and then type ./redacted -p (port) -r (HTTP
Directory (optional)).

For example, to start redacted Server on TCP port redacted with the directory for the HTML files served from a folder
called "redacted", type `./redacted -p redacted -r http`.

The HTTP Directory is optional, if not provided it looks for a folder called "redacted".

When you start the server for the first time, you'll get a message that a new database was created.

The first thing you'll want to do is go to the admin panel which is located at redacted. Type
the password "redacted" (No quotes).

The first thing you'll want to do after entering the admin panel is immediately redacted

After that, you can create a VM. redacted currently only supports QEMU at this time, however plans for supporting other
VM software are in the works.

For more information on the admin panel and its usage,
